Run command:
> dotnet-ef database update

Upon running the above command I got the following errors:
> dotnet ef database update
Could not execute because the specified command or file was not found.
Possible reasons for this include:
  * You misspelled a built-in dotnet command.
  * You intended to execute a .NET program, but dotnet-ef does not exist.
  * You intended to run a global tool, but a dotnet-prefixed executable with this name could not be found on the PATH.

As per instructions at https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/40048 I ran the following:
> dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef
You can invoke the tool using the following command: dotnet-ef
Tool 'dotnet-ef' (version '5.0.0') was successfully installed.
